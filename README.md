<h2>About IslamBot</h2>
<h3>- What is IslamBot?!</h3>
<p>> IslamBot was a verified discord bot for playing Quran in voice channels 24/7, Sending azkar & short quran videos, sending a page from the holy quran everyday!</p>
<h3>- What happend to IslamBot?!</h3>
<p>> As I can not keep working on updates and keep an eye on the bot to fix issues I decided to shut it down and share this version source code with everyone</p>
<h3>- Is is coming back online later?!</h3>
<p>> Yes! I'm planning to get it back up but unfortunately that can not be done now! maybe it is going to be back in Aug. 2023</p>

<h2>How to use our source code</h2>
<p>You will need a small discord bots programming knowledge to set it up! First of all you will need to install required library (Nextcord, mysql.connector)<br>
then you will need to set your database up, You will need MySQL database that you can manage on phpMyAdmin if you want to test that locally...
<br>Before buying a server from one of the host providers make sure they have SQL Database in the plan (Like PebbleHost)
Import SQL data using the SQL file code I uploaded!</p>
<h3>I've done everything, What to do now?</h3>
Open main.py put your database info in the DB Function variables
then go to the end and paste your bot token!
Open each file in cogs and find comments and replace what I typed there!
<hr>
<h5>Run the bot from loader.py</h5>
